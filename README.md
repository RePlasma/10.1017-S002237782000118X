Abstract: _We present a Monte Carlo collisional scheme that models single Compton scattering between leptons and photons in particle-in-cell codes. The numerical implementation of Compton scattering can deal with macro-particles of different weights and conserves momentum and energy in each collision. Our scheme is validated through two benchmarks for which exact analytical solutions exist: the inverse Compton spectra produced by an electron scattering with an isotropic photon gas and the photon–electron gas equilibrium described by the Kompaneets equation. It provides new opportunities for numerical investigation of plasma phenomena where a significant population of high-energy photons is present in the system._
